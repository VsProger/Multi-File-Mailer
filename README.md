# üìß Multi-File Mailer API

Multi-File Mailer API is a powerful tool designed to send files
to multiple email addresses, as well as for combining files into ZIP archives.
The project allows you to easily work with multipart/form-data files, simplifying
the task of bulk mailing and file management.

## üåü Features:

* **Bulk file distribution** üì¨: send a document to multiple recipients at once.
*  **Archiving** üì¶: process uploaded files to combine them into a single ZIP archive.
*  **Multiple file type support** üìÑ: process files of different MIME types such as `application/pdf`, `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`, and images.
*  **Instant access to archive information** üìä: get data about archive contents and structure.

## üìö API Routes

### 1. POST /api/archive/information
Provides information about the downloaded ZIP archive, including the size of the archive, the number of files, and the type of each file.

#### Query parameters

```

## üõ† Installation

1. Clone the repository:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/VsProger/Multi-File-Mailer-API.git
cd Multi-File-Mailer-API
```
2. Create an .env file with variables for SMTP settings:
``` 
PORT=:8080
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your_username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password
```
3. Install the dependencies and run the application:
``` 
go mod tidy
go run ./cmd/web/main.go
```
Additionally, you can use commands in the `Makefile`
* `make run`: to build and run the application
* `make clean`: to clean up binary
* `make test`: to run tests
* `make docker-run`: to build and run the application  in the docker
  
_(make sure you have make and docker)_
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Environment variables required to set up the SMTP server and API port:
- `PORT`: Port on which the API server will run (e.g., `8080`).
- `SMTP_HOST`: Address of the SMTP server (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com` for Gmail).
- `SMTP_PORT`: Port of the SMTP server (e.g., `587` for TLS).
- `SMTP_USERNAME`: Username for authentication (usually your email).
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: Password or app-specific password for authentication.

## üß™ API Testing
Using Postman:
1. Open Postman and create a new POST request.
2. Enter your server URL (http://localhost:8080/api/mail/file) and configure Body in form-data format to send files. 
3. Add a file key for the file and emails for a list of email addresses.

## üöÄ How it works
1. **File processing:** Uploaded files are validated against supported file types.
2. **Archive creation:** The API can combine multiple files into a single ZIP archive and send it to the user. 
3. **Mailing:** The API uses the specified SMTP credentials to send files to a list of recipients.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security
For Gmail and other services with two-factor authentication, it is recommended to use application passwords. Make sure your .env file is not added to the repository (add it to .gitignore).
